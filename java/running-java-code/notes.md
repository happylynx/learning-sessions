# Running Java code

## TLDR

* Usually Java is compiled into bytecode using `javac` that is later on executed by `java`.
* To run Java code one needs to provide
  * location of compiled classes
  * name of the class with the `main()` method *
* Java can also be interpreted
  * JShell
  * `java MyClass.java` 

&ast; it's a bit different with Java modules
